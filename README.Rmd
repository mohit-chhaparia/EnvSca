The R package "EnvSca" provides functions for classification of categorical time-series under the supervised learning paradigm as proposed by the authors in the below linked paper. To construct meaningful features for categorical time-series classification, the authors considered two relevant quantities: the spectral envelope and its corresponding set of optimal scalings. These quantities characterize oscillatory patterns in a categorical time-series as the largest possible power at each frequency, or spectral envelope, obtained by assigning numerical values, or scalings, to categories that optimally emphasize oscillations at each frequency. This procedure combines these two quantities to produce a feature-based classifier that can be used to accurately determine group membership for categorical time-series. For reference, see the following:

## Installation

You can install the development version of EnvSca from [GitHub](https://github.com/mohit-chhaparia/EnvSca)

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mohit-chhaparia/EnvSca")
# or
devtools::install_github("mohit-chhaparia/EnvSca", build_vignettes=TRUE)
# Note: No vignettes are added yet, hence please use the first line of code to install the package.
```

## Completed Tasks as per Project Expectations

-   README.md with information on package purpose, how to install.

-   Demo Examples are available in the Examples folder. The package has been instructed to ignore this folder while compiling. Multiple examples are available in the R documentation for env_classifier(), beta_classifier(), and gamma_classifier() functions. One example is available for all other external functions in their respective R documentations.

-   The package installs without errors.

-   Check on build generates no errors, warnings, or notes.

-   R documentation is available for 7 external R functions (includes 3 wrapper functions for 3 C++ functions). No R documentation is available for 2 internal R functions and 3 internal C++ functions.

-   [Advanced Option:]{.underline} C++ code

-   [Advanced Option:]{.underline} Testing directory for 2 external functions is available. Multiple checks are available within each external R function to ensure invalid input is not provided by the user.

-   [Advanced Options:]{.underline} Continuous Integration

-   Note: The repository has some open issues as I further intend to work on the package, add more functionality, and complete a CRAN submission. Hence, please ignore them while grading.
